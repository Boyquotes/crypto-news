live we are pressing the button oh yes guys so yes so yes yes welcome to another episode and as you can see right now if you open up your portfolio you see that Bitcoin is down 3% 3.94% and the question that everyone is asking hey Ivan will it come back will it come back or is it over guys will it really come back that's what people are asking in the comment section or at least a guy I also have one guy who's so worried as soon as we have a bit Boop to the downside always oh guys what's going to happen are we coming back oh I wasn't prepared for such a fast dump of 4% I wasn't prepared for it oh my listen this is what's happening right now let me tell you on the short this was happening right now Bitcoin is in a bullish Trend as long as we don't close a week below 58 so you got to ask yourself are we are we above 58 yes we are we are in a bullish TR and actually even if we go down below 58 but then come back up and close the week above it still we're going to be in a bullish Trend so what has happened right now is that basically the scenario which we discussed yesterday which would be the ideal scenario where we just pump past 70k and we don't revisit it it didn't turn out instead we have a more sideway scenario where we're still stuck at 70k we're still stuck in this area around 69 70 and and normally that happens when we break alltime High normally that happens again I've been showing you this uh last cycle we were at 20K for quite some time before we broke it if you look here here we were for a month around 20K before we broke the alltime high we broke this previous High and um continued pumping and this time I had a bullish hope that actually we wouldn't be here for as long but history does Rhyme very very much and it seems that we are stuck still at this alltime High area and we still have not had our big fat candle that takes us towards 75 80k where we don't even look back at 70 so each and every day in a bull market we roll the dice and with highest probability each and every day we pumped obviously probability means that it's not 100% and sometimes like today we do have a pullback of 4% with likelihood that tomorrow and the day after is bullish that's always how it is in a bull market that's why you buy the dip in a bull market if it is a bull market you buy the dip you don't get overly worried you buy the dip if it keeps dipping you still buy it that's why it's smart to not go all in on your first buy the dip you can distribute the capital a bit because again we may still go lower and if we go to 58 we're still bullish that's the power of the money line because it really shows you that we're still bullish even though though we fall and your gut feeling would be so panicking it would wreck you way way before because you would be selling too early but listen at the end of day in a bull market you buy the dip likelihood is that in a bull market we keep going up look here dips are for buying in a bull market I wrote it yesterday and of course someone in the guy in the comment section but Ivan it's dumping I'm scared what if it dumps more what if it dumps more it can dump more it can it always can it's a market it's not a free money machine it's a market it goes up it goes down in a bull market it mostly goes up that's why I'm telling you to sit down ensure that your konas are still there with one hand let you know guys if they're still there and with the other hand you start buying okay so you use both hands for this operation very important so you start buying okay very important in a bull market we we do have this scare scary dumps uh like we had one last week guys I mean people don't remember but you know last week we did dump quite a bit as well you remember last week we were we were below 60k last week guys does anyone remember it or or everyone always forgot because some some guy in the oh man it's so I'm so scared bro last week we were at we were below we were below 60 last week it was one week ago it was seven days ago seven days ago 10 days like listen it's it was last week we were below 60 I was telling you it's going to be bullish now we're right below 70 so if you just zoom out from your like one minute chart where you're super scared on the one minute chart you're so scared you know I what's going to happen if you zoom out you look at the maybe weekly maybe even daily so you see at least a week back you're going to get a way bigger picture anyway we have a lot to discuss we have a lot to talk about all there's all kinds of discounts in the market right now it's a bull market so with one hand you're checking you know what you got to check with one hand we add with the other hand you clicking to buy okay not Financial advice listen if we go to zero and you bought it's your fault because you wanted to make some profit huh you want to make some dineros some monies you take your the risk with your money I'm telling you what I'm doing guys welcome everyone to the

seeing the following we're seeing most coins down H hex PEX a bit up this um eex is also up although Richard Hart kind of abandoned it you guys all of your hexans let let me know what the hell happened but Richard har basically said that this is Kaka this is this is no Bano basically anymore and and that this is the real hex now so I I don't know it dumped like hell now it pumps again but you guys know more if you are in the community looking at the seven days it is a bit of a mixed bag but you see for example near 50% soanzo 23% uh we've had all of the mem coins on Solana going nuts

coin but 188 like this is the thing people so worried you know what's happening Ian what's happening you just zoom out you zoom out that's why you can use Morales money in an easy way to see to see on the bubble View and you get a way way better picture so Bitcoin I think you guys understand the situation and look your James said like lockwork when the ETFs buy Bitcoin uh before that you see the dump a bit of a dump before they buy okay uh spot the pattern happening since January 12th now this is a bit of a conspiracy I guess it would be awesome to uh to get James to get more into this but I guess there is something happening to get the price a bit lower uh for the ETF for the ETF buy because it's like clockwork Boop and then they buy Boop and they buy Boop and they buy dump and they buy now dump if this pattern continues you know what's going to happen and the thing is in a bull market it's I mean the patterns they are like clockwork I remember also in 20 2020 uh when Bitcoin dumped you buy you wait a few days it pumps back up like it was like clockwork it was like obviously it stops working at some point when the when the bare Market starts you buy and the dip keeps dipping okay that's when the bare Market starts but if you buy and you know and it dips again and then it dips again but how do you know it's a bare Market you know it by using the money line again if we if we close a week below 57 the money line will flip bearish and by the way what's on the weekly and again on bitcoin I'm using the weekly uh and again looking at the targets we've had this flag formation we're right now at the Target price of the flag formation so we basically hit it and you you know that the flag formation is like this you measure from the last bottom to the flag and then you measure from the breakout breakout area and up and and we we've hit it very exactly uh and what H what happens right now is that we may go sideways this week I mean this week is definitely sideways uh what's going to happen next week let's let's see but we have a bigger Target and this is this you know if you watch Kevin senson because he speaks a lot about the parabolas and the final leg of the parabola is twice as big as the price of the base of the last base so Parabola basically goes like this you know it pumps then is it bit sideways then it pumps more then it's a bit sideways and then it pumps more and so what you see right here is like the last base here and according to textbook the leg up following it following it is doubling the price okay so based on that analysis the longer term uh Target basically within the coming months is at around 90k because basically we double this 45 okay so these are the two Targets one is already met this is based on the flag and the other one a bit more longterm is 90k so this is the long-term Target that we are looking at there is a good chance we hit it in April because it will also coincide with James um James prediction of 99k just just below 100 let's see guys but all in all the conclusion is bullish and yo
