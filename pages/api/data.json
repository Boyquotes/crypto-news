{"transcript":"Time: 0.08 - Text: live we are pressing the button oh yes\nTime: 2.96 - Text: guys so yes so yes yes welcome to\nTime: 5.44 - Text: another episode and as you can see right\nTime: 7.72 - Text: now if you open up your portfolio you\nTime: 10.24 - Text: see that Bitcoin is down 3%\nTime: 13.559 - Text: 3.94% and the question that everyone is\nTime: 16.039 - Text: asking hey Ivan will it come back will\nTime: 18.96 - Text: it come back or is it over guys will it\nTime: 23.16 - Text: really come back that's what people are\nTime: 24.72 - Text: asking in the comment section or at\nTime: 26.199 - Text: least a guy I also have one guy who's so\nTime: 29.279 - Text: worried as soon as we have a bit Boop to\nTime: 31.72 - Text: the downside always oh guys what's going\nTime: 34.32 - Text: to happen are we coming back oh I wasn't\nTime: 36.84 - Text: prepared for such a fast dump of 4% I\nTime: 41.12 - Text: wasn't prepared for it oh my listen this\nTime: 43.32 - Text: is what's happening right now let me\nTime: 44.6 - Text: tell you on the short this was happening\nTime: 46.32 - Text: right now Bitcoin is in a bullish Trend\nTime: 50.36 - Text: as long as we don't close a week below\nTime: 54.16 - Text: 58 so you got to ask yourself are we are\nTime: 57.239 - Text: we above 58 yes we are we are in a\nTime: 60.879 - Text: bullish TR and actually even if we go\nTime: 63.6 - Text: down below 58 but then come back up and\nTime: 66.32 - Text: close the week above it still we're\nTime: 68.84 - Text: going to be in a bullish Trend so what\nTime: 70.96 - Text: has happened right now is that basically\nTime: 72.92 - Text: the scenario which we discussed\nTime: 74.479 - Text: yesterday which would be the ideal\nTime: 76.2 - Text: scenario where we just pump past 70k and\nTime: 79.08 - Text: we don't revisit it it didn't turn out\nTime: 81.64 - Text: instead we have a more sideway scenario\nTime: 84.159 - Text: where we're still stuck at 70k we're\nTime: 86.36 - Text: still stuck in this area around 69 70\nTime: 89.759 - Text: and and normally that happens when we\nTime: 91.36 - Text: break alltime High normally that happens\nTime: 94.0 - Text: again I've been showing you this uh last\nTime: 96.119 - Text: cycle we were at 20K for quite some time\nTime: 99.64 - Text: before we broke it if you look here here\nTime: 101.96 - Text: we were for a month around 20K before we\nTime: 105.24 - Text: broke the alltime high we broke this\nTime: 106.88 - Text: previous High and um continued pumping\nTime: 110.119 - Text: and this time I had a bullish hope that\nTime: 113.6 - Text: actually we wouldn't be here for as long\nTime: 116.399 - Text: but history does Rhyme very very much\nTime: 119.52 - Text: and it seems that we are stuck still at\nTime: 122.039 - Text: this alltime High area and we still have\nTime: 124.759 - Text: not had our big fat candle that takes us\nTime: 128.56 - Text: towards 75 80k where we don't even look\nTime: 131.959 - Text: back at 70 so each and every day in a\nTime: 135.04 - Text: bull market we roll the dice and with\nTime: 137.72 - Text: highest probability each and every day\nTime: 139.76 - Text: we pumped obviously probability means\nTime: 142.28 - Text: that it's not 100% and sometimes like\nTime: 144.72 - Text: today we do have a pullback of 4% with\nTime: 148.879 - Text: likelihood that tomorrow and the day\nTime: 151.16 - Text: after is bullish that's always how it is\nTime: 152.84 - Text: in a bull market that's why you buy the\nTime: 154.599 - Text: dip in a bull market if it is a bull\nTime: 157.08 - Text: market you buy the dip you don't get\nTime: 160.36 - Text: overly worried you buy the dip if it\nTime: 162.92 - Text: keeps dipping you still buy it that's\nTime: 164.76 - Text: why it's smart to not go all in on your\nTime: 167.319 - Text: first buy the dip you can distribute the\nTime: 169.319 - Text: capital a bit because again we may still\nTime: 171.56 - Text: go lower and if we go to 58 we're still\nTime: 174.56 - Text: bullish that's the power of the money\nTime: 177.0 - Text: line because it really shows you that\nTime: 178.68 - Text: we're still bullish even though though\nTime: 180.04 - Text: we fall and your gut feeling would be so\nTime: 182.879 - Text: panicking it would wreck you way way\nTime: 185.48 - Text: before because you would be selling too\nTime: 186.959 - Text: early but listen at the end of day in a\nTime: 188.92 - Text: bull market you buy the dip likelihood\nTime: 191.48 - Text: is that in a bull market we keep going\nTime: 194.36 - Text: up look here dips are for buying in a\nTime: 197.12 - Text: bull market I wrote it yesterday and of\nTime: 198.72 - Text: course someone in the guy in the comment\nTime: 200.28 - Text: section but Ivan it's dumping I'm scared\nTime: 202.519 -

Text: buy Bitcoin uh before that you see the\nTime: 516.12 - Text: dump a bit of a dump before they buy\nTime: 518.32 - Text: okay uh spot the pattern happening since\nTime: 521.08 - Text: January 12th now this is a bit of a\nTime: 523.839 - Text: conspiracy I guess it would be awesome\nTime: 525.6 - Text: to uh to get James to get more into this\nTime: 528.76 - Text: but I guess there is something happening\nTime: 530.959 - Text: to get the price a bit lower uh for the\nTime: 534.32 - Text: ETF for the ETF buy because it's like\nTime: 536.64 - Text: clockwork Boop and then they buy Boop\nTime: 538.279 - Text: and they buy Boop and they buy dump and\nTime: 540.24 - Text: they buy now dump if this pattern\nTime: 542.72 - Text: continues you know what's going to\nTime: 543.76 - Text: happen and the thing is in a bull market\nTime: 545.8 - Text: it's I mean the patterns they are like\nTime: 547.399 - Text: clockwork I remember also in 20 2020 uh\nTime: 551.399 - Text: when Bitcoin dumped you buy you wait a\nTime: 554.2 - Text: few days it pumps back up like it was\nTime: 556.36 - Text: like clockwork it was like obviously it\nTime: 558.2 - Text: stops working at some point when the\nTime: 559.959 - Text: when the bare Market starts you buy and\nTime: 562.48 - Text: the dip keeps dipping okay that's when\nTime: 564.399 - Text: the bare Market starts but if you buy\nTime: 566.48 - Text: and you know and it dips again and then\nTime: 568.36 - Text: it dips again but how do you know it's a\nTime: 570.16 - Text: bare Market you know it by using the\nTime: 572.079 - Text: money line again if we if we close a\nTime: 574.36 - Text: week below 57 the money line will flip\nTime: 577.8 - Text: bearish and by the way what's on the\nTime: 579.72 - Text: weekly and again on bitcoin I'm using\nTime: 581.2 - Text: the weekly uh and again looking at the\nTime: 584.079 - Text: targets we've had this flag formation\nTime: 586.32 - Text: we're right now at the Target price of\nTime: 588.2 - Text: the flag formation so we basically hit\nTime: 590.68 - Text: it and you you know that the flag\nTime: 592.2 - Text: formation is like this you measure from\nTime: 593.839 - Text: the last bottom to the flag and then you\nTime: 596.6 - Text: measure from the breakout breakout area\nTime: 598.76 - Text: and up and and we we've hit it very\nTime: 601.12 - Text: exactly uh and what H what happens right\nTime: 603.44 - Text: now is that we may go sideways this week\nTime: 605.279 - Text: I mean this week is definitely sideways\nTime: 607.2 - Text: uh what's going to happen next week\nTime: 608.6 - Text: let's let's see but we have a bigger\nTime: 610.16 - Text: Target and this is this you know if you\nTime: 612.36 - Text: watch Kevin senson because he speaks a\nTime: 614.279 - Text: lot about the parabolas and the final\nTime: 617.44 - Text: leg of the parabola is twice as big as\nTime: 622.32 - Text: the price of the base of the last base\nTime: 625.8 - Text: so Parabola basically goes like this you\nTime: 627.48 - Text: know it pumps then is it bit sideways\nTime: 629.88 - Text: then it pumps more then it's a bit\nTime: 631.48 - Text: sideways and then it pumps more and so\nTime: 633.88 - Text: what you see right here is like the last\nTime: 636.519 - Text: base here and according to textbook the\nTime: 640.04 - Text: leg up following it following it is\nTime: 643.839 - Text: doubling the price okay so based on that\nTime: 646.519 - Text: analysis the longer term uh Target\nTime: 650.519 - Text: basically within the coming months is at\nTime: 653.279 - Text: around 90k because basically we double\nTime: 655.32 - Text: this 45 okay so these are the two\nTime: 658.079 - Text: Targets one is already met this is based\nTime: 659.839 - Text: on the flag and the other one a bit more\nTime: 661.56 - Text: longterm is 90k so this is the long-term\nTime: 664.72 - Text: Target that we are looking at there is a\nTime: 667.36 - Text: good chance we hit it in April because\nTime: 669.88 - Text: it will also coincide with James um\nTime: 673.32 - Text: James prediction of 99k just just below\nTime: 676.68 - Text: 100 let's see guys but all in all the\nTime: 678.519 - Text: conclusion is\nTime: 680.0 - Text: bullish and you need to have conviction\nTime: 682.839 - Text: here I know some people are scared you\nTime: 684.24 - Text: know it's dumping but again look back\nTime: 686.36 - Text: last week we were at 59 okay last week\nTime: 689.92 - Text: today we're at 68 but people are so\nTime: 693.36 - Text: scared and that's why you see that\nTime: 695.12 -

Text: market seriously now moving on let's\nTime: 757.88 - Text: speak a bit about the upgrade that\nTime: 759.399 - Text: happened to eth yesterday so upgrade\nTime: 762.279 - Text: happened and what happened we cut the\nTime: 764.279 - Text: layer two fees basically to zero look\nTime: 767.16 - Text: here this is unis swap fee on optimism\nTime: 771.36 - Text: okay it went from this to basically\nTime: 775.8 - Text: zero it went to zero I mean this is the\nTime: 778.56 - Text: power of that upgrade that happened\nTime: 780.399 - Text: yesterday and by the way the upgrade\nTime: 782.959 - Text: yesterday it doesn't cut Feast on layer\nTime: 785.399 - Text: one uh it cut Feast on Layer Two because\nTime: 788.279 - Text: it makes it cheaper for layer twos to\nTime: 790.56 - Text: commit their state to layer one\nTime: 792.56 - Text: obviously I mean to some extent it will\nTime: 795.32 - Text: also affect layer one Fe but in a minor\nTime: 797.32 - Text: way probably not in a like life-changing\nTime: 800.199 - Text: way but on Layer Two it is totally\nTime: 802.76 - Text: different like all layer twos are now\nTime: 805.0 - Text: totally different when it comes to their\nTime: 807.36 - Text: fees and that's great to see and and by\nTime: 809.32 - Text: the way also another thing now that eth\nTime: 811.079 - Text: did this upgrade there is there is a lot\nTime: 812.959 - Text: of debate on Twitter you know that oh\nTime: 815.04 -

Text: the market right now so Axel the first\nTime: 892.0 - Text: one is that the first thing to know\nTime: 894.36 - Text: about it is that we did see a fantastic\nTime: 896.959 - Text: pump you know we've been bullish on a on\nTime: 899.079 - Text: AEL for forever I mean somewhere in 2023\nTime: 902.32 - Text: we start I don't know exactly when but\nTime: 904.12 - Text: it was like somewhere here uh it\nTime: 906.48 - Text: basically did almost 10 x like 7x uh now\nTime: 910.079 - Text: it is down a bit and in my mind it's a\nTime: 913.279 - Text: good discount although wait for it to\nTime: 915.279 - Text: find the Bottom now it is still uh\nTime: 917.68 - Text: dumping too fast you see it's still like\nTime: 920.04 - Text: accelerating down but within the coming\nTime: 922.56 - Text: days it may find the bottom and go a bit\nTime: 924.68 - Text: sideways because it is likely to go\nTime: 926.199 - Text: sideways before it goes up so just keep\nTime: 928.279 - Text: an eye on it uh and what's important\nTime: 931.319 - Text: with it is that they have all kinds of\nTime: 932.68 - Text: upgrades they have all kinds of um uh\nTime: 935.16 - Text: volume they have all kinds of metrics\nTime: 937.16 - Text: all kinds of chains and all in all the\nTime: 939.68 - Text: success of Axel is clear from onchain\nTime: 942.56 - Text: activity from how much people are using\nTime: 944.36 - Text: it their tech for for interchain\nTime: 946.72 - Text: communication is used a lot like a lot a\nTime: 949.079 - Text: lot a lot also on the money line you can\nTime: 953.24 - Text: see it here we are currently in a\nTime: 956.92 - Text: bullish Trend let me see on the\nTime: 959.839 - Text: even on the weekly is bullish look here\nTime: 961.639 - Text: on the weekly Axel in is in a super\nTime: 964.399 - Text: bullish trend on The Daily let's see if\nTime: 966.399 - Text: it's still bullish there uh loading\nTime: 969.0 - Text: loading loading there on the daily it's\nTime: 971.12 - Text: also bullish okay so look for it to find\nTime: 975.839 - Text: the uh a bottom here uh maybe it will go\nTime: 978.56 - Text: down even to 0.6 and just use the money\nTime: 981.56 - Text: line as support and then Boop continue\nTime: 983.959 - Text: to the upside Could Happen could very\nTime: 985.519 - Text: much happen uh so that's it with Axel uh\nTime: 988.68 - Text: good good traction and uh good price\nTime: 990.959 - Text: performance as well looking at poka dot\nTime: 993.44 - Text: we are seeing poka do pump quite nicely\nTime: 995.92 - Text: as well let me bring a to here on the\nTime: 997.759 - Text: money line so we can check but during\nTime: 999.8 - Text: the\nTime: 1000.759 - Text: past past uh weeks it's been so nice I\nTime: 1004.04 - Text: mean look at this trend you should have\nTime: 1005.279 - Text: bought here when the money line flipped\nTime: 1007.12 - Text: bullish that's why if you use the link\nTime: 1009.36 - Text: below you get the money line also as\nTime: 1011.0 - Text: part of the Easter promo but this is the\nTime: 1012.92 - Text: power of buying it when you know when it\nTime: 1014.839 - Text: FS bullish because you can still try to\nTime: 1017.92 - Text: buy here as well it's just better to buy\nTime: 1020.04 - Text: it when it's when it just F bullish but\nTime: 1021.959 - Text: it's still in a bullish Trend and a\nTime: 1023.399 - Text: bullish trend is likely to keep pumping\nTime: 1025.679 - Text: and be bullish so B is looking very nice\nTime: 1028.959 - Text: um it is on a discount right now it went\nTime: 1031.64 - Text: to 11.8 now it is at 10.5 it could\nTime: 1035.319 - Text: continue lower all the way here to 9.2\nTime: 1037.48 - Text: just to keep in mind but to start dcing\nTime: 1039.64 - Text: in if you want poka do and you're not in\nTime: 1041.439 - Text: PKA do this is a good uh this is a good\nTime: 1043.919 -

Text: 9.2 but then you know that it's a good\nTime: 1054.12 - Text: opportunity to buy as well so DCA in\nTime: 1056.88 - Text: knowing that potentially we go we go\nTime: 1058.84 - Text: down here so that's polot and in terms\nTime: 1061.6 -

Text: obvious I don't think it's the top but\nTime: 1166.76 - Text: um it it could be the top\nTime: 1169.799 - Text: in terms of like you know the top signal\nTime: 1171.76 - Text: sponsoring the sponsoring the what the\nTime: 1175.039 -

Text: is it the end of the bull market\nTime: 1195.08 - Text: according to all analysis we're just in\nTime: 1198.2 - Text: the early days of the bull market\nTime: 1199.679 - Text: because we're just now pushing the\nTime: 1200.799 - Text: alltime high but according to this you\nTime: 1203.76 - Text: know um Baseball American football Super\nTime: 1207.039 - Text: Ball bum bum but by the way why why is\nTime: 1209.24 - Text: it called Super Ball because ball is\nTime: 1212.2 - Text: like cereal ball okay you get cereal you\nTime: 1215.159 - Text: put it in the ball you get some mango\nTime: 1218.76 - Text: chopped up you put it in the ball and\nTime: 1221.36 - Text: Super Ball it's another ball like I I\nTime: 1223.32 - Text: never got it and but anyway they are\nTime: 1227.2 - Text: going to sponsor the Super Bowl okay not\nTime: 1229.24 - Text: not super they going to sponsor the\nTime: 1231.24 - Text: sphere which is a ball but another kind\nTime: 1233.52 -

Text: is like the cereal ball and the Super\nTime: 1248.08 - Text: Ball I don't know if there's any\nTime: 1250.08 - Text: difference but anyway they are they are\nTime: 1252.88 - Text: sponsoring it so just Ju Just beware in\nTime: 1256.36 - Text: case this is this is a top signal that\nTime: 1258.24 - Text: then you you've heard it at least you've\nTime: 1259.76 - Text: heard it at least based on all analysis\nTime: 1262.559 - Text: it should not be the top but based on\nTime: 1264.28 - Text: like the Super Bowl red flag and like\nTime: 1266.96 - Text: sphere let's see let's let me know what\nTime: 1268.88 - Text: you think guys by the\nTime: 1270.36 - Text: way H let me know what you think okay\nTime: 1273.6 - Text: let's see by the way the the beat the\nTime: 1275.64 - Text: beat and I take some\nTime: 1281.08 - Text: coffee stadium is shaped like a ball ah\nTime: 1284.559 - Text: is it how it is I'm smoking also a ball\nTime: 1288.159 - Text: Maybe that's how it is I have no clue\nTime: 1289.88 - Text: also there is fish ball where you put\nTime: 1291.64 - Text: your goldfish now or origin Trail some\nTime: 1294.76 - Text: updates here as well not too big of a\nTime: 1296.96 - Text: discount not too big of a discount\nTime: 1298.84 - Text: although well it went too okay it's\nTime: 1300.679 - Text: quite a big discount never mind I I\nTime: 1302.12 - Text: forgot how high it went I just remember\nTime: 1304.12 - Text: that it went above a dollar I thought\nTime: 1305.52 - Text: it's amazing but it actually went to 1.5\nTime: 1308.52 - Text: so it it was super bullish but anyway\nTime: 1311.52 - Text: anyway uh then we have the uh discount\nTime: 1315.559 - Text: here quite nice uh from 1.5 to .2 could\nTime: 1319.24 - Text: go lower still because again just watch\nTime: 1321.279 - Text: for it to reach some sideways move okay\nTime: 1323.4 - Text: some sideways that's that's what I'm\nTime: 1325.12 - Text: looking at let's actually see on the\nTime: 1326.799 - Text: money line how it is\nTime: 1330.12 - Text: doing uh oh look here look look here\nTime: 1332.48 - Text: look here on the money line on the daily\nTime: 1334.44 - Text: it just entered bearish so this is guys\nTime: 1336.48 - Text: this is like the the the best\nTime: 1338.919 - Text: opportunity here okay you see here it\nTime: 1341.76 - Text: also entered bearish so you have to buy\nTime: 1343.88 - Text: next time it flips bullish how do you\nTime: 1345.36 - Text: know it you can set an alert in trading\nTime: 1347.679 - Text: view you can set an alert how to do it\nTime: 1349.72 - Text: you will get instruction once you get\nTime: 1351.799 - Text: into the Easter deal but this is\nTime: 1354.72 - Text: probably probably the best opportunity\nTime: 1357.6 - Text: because now it's bearish you see I mean\nTime: 1359.64 - Text: it can be bearish for a few days but man\nTime: 1362.24 - Text: once this thing is bullish if you just\nTime: 1364.48 - Text: bought here when it told you to be\nTime: 1365.919 - Text: bullish at this close to the peak you\nTime: 1368.96 - Text: would you would get 130% okay so use the\nTime: 1373.88 - Text: opportunity use the opportunity because\nTime: 1376.919 - Text: this is I mean this is textbook if this\nTime: 1379.2 - Text: continues for a few days bum bum bum bum\nTime: 1380.88 - Text: bum and then Boop you can you can long\nTime: 1383.12 - Text: it after it turns bullish very good but\nTime: 1386.6 - Text: uh they just released their staking so\nTime: 1389.36 - Text: basically they are allowing everyone to\nTime: 1391.88 - Text: stake you get\nTime: 1393.12 - Text: 20.8% apy currently and this is not from\nTime: 1396.44 - Text: inflation there is no inflation when it\nTime: 1398.64 - Text: comes to staking uh staking comes from\nTime: 1401.559 - Text: other people that want to write\nTime: 1404.279 - Text: knowledge onto the knowledge graph\nTime: 1405.96 - Text: because the way it works is that when\nTime: 1407.159 - Text: you publish your knowledge asset you pay\nTime: 1410.08 - Text: the network that payment goes to the\nTime: 1411.96 - Text: stakers who run the validator so when\nTime: 1413.88 - Text: you stake you run your validator or you\nTime: 1416.64 - Text: stake to a validator okay and then you\nTime: 1419.559 - Text: get income from other people that want\nTime: 1421.88 - Text: to use the network and that's your\nTime: 1424.36 - Text: reward and currently there's a lot of\nTime: 1426.0 - Text: demand to put stuff on the on the\nTime: 1429.44 - Text: knowledge graph and that's why currently\nTime: 1431.52 - Text: based on the current demand you get\nTime: 1434.24 - Text: 20.8% uh apy in the network and also\nTime: 1437.76 - Text: they are releasing a new chain for\nTime: 1441.24 - Text: knowledge mining specifically so track\nTime: 1443.64 - Text: is going to be used for staking and U\nTime: 1446.88 - Text: validating the chain and then also keep\nTime: 1449.12 - Text: an eye on this neuro web AI we're going\nTime: 1451.08 - Text: to speak more about it as it arrives but\nTime: 1452.799 - Text: this is also from origin Trail and in in\nTime: 1455.039 - Text: the same ecosystem basically uh next\nTime: 1457.76 - Text: next next let's speak about Avalanche\nTime: 1459.52 - Text: Avalanche is down\nTime: 1461.559 - Text: 3% see this is good it is a bit sideways\nTime: 1464.76 - Text: I like this it's not accelerating down\nTime: 1466.44 - Text: it's a bit sideways so probably it's a\nTime: 1469.159 - Text: good opportunity basically everything is\nTime: 1471.52 - Text: handing on the fact that Bitcoin doesn't\nTime: 1473.2 - Text: nuke to like 20K when we speak about all\nTime: 1475.48 - Text: coins just a\nTime: 1476.679 - Text: reminder\nTime: 1479.279 - Text: uh a big fat arrow that we drew when did\nTime: 1482.88 - Text: we draw it well we drew it here exactly\nTime: 1486.919 - Text: man this turned out very nice so last\nTime: 1490.039 - Text: time I had this chart up we drew this\nTime: 1492.0 - Text: fat Arrow yeah because it was see here\nTime: 1494.559 - Text: it was breaking this see some people are\nTime: 1496.72 - Text: saying technical analysis doesn't work\nTime: 1498.799 - Text: like money line how can guys listen I\nTime: 1501.2 - Text: just pulled this up for the first time\nTime: 1502.799 - Text: since since like here November December\nTime: 1505.24 - Text: where we said basically look here this\nTime: 1506.799 - Text: is a massive resistance and this is uh\nTime: 1509.919 - Text: sorry yeah this is the resistance and\nTime: 1511.32 - Text: here's the resistance so if we break\nTime: 1513.08 - Text: above it we're going to snap to the\nTime: 1514.559 - Text: upper band and this is what happened man\nTime: 1516.36 - Text: it's like clockwork it's crazy it is\nTime: 1518.52 - Text: like clockwork this is the power of\nTime: 1519.84 - Text: having good tools like the money line\nTime: 1521.679 - Text: and good Community as well but anyway it\nTime: 1524.12 - Text: is bullish uh on the money line which is\nTime: 1526.84 - Text: great and currently\nTime: 1528.84 - Text: uh and currently it is testing this uh I\nTime: 1531.799 - Text: think it's going to test this resistance\nTime: 1533.52 - Text: here if it snaps this resistance we're\nTime: 1536.559 - Text: going to snap to alltime high okay if it\nTime: 1539.36 - Text: snaps this so for Avalanche keep an eye\nTime: 1542.08 - Text: on it it is dumping quite nicely now\nTime: 1544.679 - Text: good discount and uh just so you know\nTime: 1548.32 - Text: worst case it goes here to 44 and it\nTime: 1550.64 - Text: will still be in a bullish Trend if it\nTime: 1552.08 - Text: goes to 44 uh in case it goes below it\nTime: 1555.88 - Text: we're going to flip bearish and then the\nTime: 1557.48 - Text: next opportunity will will be to see the\nTime: 1559.12 - Text: next bullish flip so basically like all\nTime: 1561.6 - Text: scenarios are on the table that it it\nTime: 1563.679 - Text: can either go so the scenario number so\nTime: 1567.2 - Text: like it's all about main scenarios but\nTime: 1568.679 - Text: it's likelihood that is important what\nTime: 1570.159 - Text: is most likely let me tell you what's\nTime: 1571.76 - Text: most likely based on likelihood because\nTime: 1575.24 - Text: it is in a bullish Trend I think that is\nTime: 1577.44 - Text: going to test this that's the scenario\nTime: 1579.679 - Text: number one uh scenario number two which\nTime: 1581.96 - Text: is a bit less likely but still very\nTime: 1584.279 - Text: possible that's that we go here we get\nTime: 1586.12 - Text: support and we go like this and then\nTime: 1588.6 - Text: least likely but can still happen\nTime: 1590.2 - Text: because again it's likelihood does that\nTime: 1592.039 - Text: will actually go Bel below here and then\nTime: 1594.32 - Text: you're going to have a good opportunity\nTime: 1595.679 - Text: to long it once it flips bullish so in\nTime: 1599.039 - Text: markets there's no certainty people that\nTime: 1600.919 - Text: want certainty they don't know what\nTime: 1602.399 - Text: they're doing it's all about likelihood\nTime: 1604.159 - Text: and uh based on the current situation\nTime: 1606.36 - Text: this is the likelihood but we're and\nTime: 1608.0 - Text: again the most important indicator is\nTime: 1609.52 - Text: that we're bullish on the money line\nTime: 1610.919 - Text: because we're bullish on the money line\nTime: 1612.039 - Text: we're likely to keep going going up in\nTime: 1614.159 - Text: terms of updates they have a lot they\nTime: 1615.679 - Text: have the Durango update they have the\nTime: 1617.32 - Text: teleporter basically bringing all of the\nTime: 1619.799 - Text: different subnets together so you can\nTime: 1622.72 - Text: easily move assets you can easily trade\nTime: 1625.0 - Text: across chains and all of that uh super\nTime: 1627.24 - Text: fantastic upgrade that they have done\nTime: 1629.279 - Text: and uh a lot of subnet are adopting it\nTime: 1631.72 - Text: and also all of this is based on another\nTime: 1634.0 - Text: update that happened quite some time ago\nTime: 1636.12 - Text: I mean this is from 2022 this is this\nTime: 1639.96 - Text: warp messaging so now that warp\nTime: 1642.0 - Text: messaging has been in place for over a\nTime: 1643.76 - Text: year they could they could do that U uh\nTime: 1646.96 - Text: that teleporter to move assets uh\nTime: 1649.12 - Text: smoothly across chains next next next\nTime: 1651.76 - Text: radx man radx back from the dead back\nTime: 1656.0 - Text: into the saddle let's see on the\nTime: 1659.399 - Text: chart how it is doing in terms of the\nTime: 1662.159 - Text: money line it is I mean man it's been\nTime: 1664.559 - Text: ranging for so long see this is the\nTime: 1667.159 - Text: power of the money line it got you in\nTime: 1668.799 - Text: very nicely here uh money line flip\nTime: 1671.519 - Text: bullish\nTime: 1673.2 - Text: here uh and yeah now we're Rising quite\nTime: 1676.2 - Text: nicely to the upside what's important is\nTime: 1678.64 - Text: that again we're bullish we just I mean\nTime: 1680.799 - Text: we just snapped from this massive\nTime: 1682.799 - Text: resistance that has been here since May\nTime: 1685.6 - Text: and when it comes to fundamentals so\nTime: 1687.44 - Text: basically the next Target let me tell\nTime: 1688.919 - Text: the next Target the next Target would be\nTime: 1690.48 - Text: to retest this\nTime: 1693.399 - Text: 04 let's see if it plays out like the\nTime: 1695.96 - Text: other one uh but I would draw it\nTime: 1698.36 - Text: something like this uh obviously if\nTime: 1701.24 - Text: Bitcoin doesn't do Kaka okay in the bed\nTime: 1706.919 - Text: that that's the only\nTime: 1708.84 - Text: prerequisite okay um so this this would\nTime: 1712.32 - Text: be my number one scenario obviously\nTime: 1714.36 - Text: there is some resistance uh on on the\nTime: 1716.24 - Text: way up like you can argue that this may\nTime: 1717.76 - Text: be a resistance uh see how awesome I\nTime: 1721.44 - Text: draw this can also be a resistance\nTime: 1723.32 - Text: before we we get there and yeah it's all\nTime: 1726.159 - Text: about the strength do we do we still\nTime: 1728.039 - Text: have strength in this move or not uh\nTime: 1729.96 - Text: we're going to see it based on how we\nTime: 1732.24 - Text: smash or not smash this resistance but\nTime: 1735.039 - Text: yeah this would probably be the first\nTime: 1736.519 - Text: one to keep an eye on because we may\nTime: 1738.36 - Text: actually uh get rejected here if the\nTime: 1740.799 - Text: strength is not there I mean if if the\nTime: 1743.0 - Text: RIS is not really bullish we we still\nTime: 1745.44 - Text: have to see it looks super bullish now\nTime: 1747.32 - Text: but are there going to be a lot of sell\nTime: 1749.84 - Text: pressure into this pump or will the\nTime: 1752.559 - Text: price ride to this highs uh we'll have\nTime: 1756.32 - Text: to see how the market reacts how the\nTime: 1757.799 - Text: psychology of the market reacts many\nTime: 1760.039 - Text: people I can tell you they sold radics\nTime: 1762.48 - Text: here like at the very bottom basically\nTime: 1765.2 - Text: because they really lost confidence and\nTime: 1768.44 - Text: everyone I saw a lot on Twitter people\nTime: 1770.399 - Text: were selling so if they now form more\nTime: 1773.44 - Text: back in I think we're going to snap to\nTime: 1775.32 - Text: 0.15 but anyway in terms of fundamentals\nTime: 1777.76 - Text: they have the growth in tvl which is\nTime: 1779.679 - Text: very nice they have this ignition thing\nTime: 1781.2 - Text: going as well uh Pierce who is heading\nTime: 1784.36 - Text: the uh RDX works is U working well I\nTime: 1788.76 - Text: don't know if he's working together but\nTime: 1789.96 - Text: at least he's bringing attention to the\nTime: 1792.76 - Text: culture coins like hug and early on\nTime: 1795.32 - Text: radic which are the meme coins which is\nTime: 1797.08 - Text: good because you don't want your like\nTime: 1799.519 - Text: you know uh head of development be too\nTime: 1802.6 - Text: serious like at the end of the day we're\nTime: 1804.08 - Text: here to have fun we're here to trade\nTime: 1806.36 - Text: we're here to go nuts we're here to make\nTime: 1807.96 - Text: money the blockchain need to facilitate\nTime: 1810.159 - Text: that in a good way we don't want like a\nTime: 1813.12 - Text: super serious chain so that's good so\nTime: 1815.159 - Text: let's see how it continues but right now\nTime: 1816.96 - Text: I think it is um it is quite clear path\nTime: 1820.159 - Text: to this Highs but here is where the\nTime: 1822.279 - Text: market it will tell us like are the\nTime: 1824.96 - Text: holders confident or are the holders\nTime: 1827.2 - Text: going to dump and yes or no um and\nTime: 1830.96 - Text: likely likely a lot of people that sold\nTime: 1833.2 - Text: here are fing in in this areas let's see\nTime: 1836.84 - Text: how that evolves but that's update on\nTime: 1839.519 - Text: that next we have some new coins so in\nTime: 1843.84 - Text: terms of new ones let me show you um\nTime: 1847.12 - Text: there was star Heroes that did a very\nTime: 1849.84 - Text: nice uh\nTime: 1851.96 - Text: mint Heroes let me bring it up in terms\nTime: 1856.399 - Text: of new there's star Heroes\nTime: 1858.519 - Text: uh which is likely to do well we spoke\nTime: 1861.24 - Text: about it in our uh Discord likely to do\nTime: 1864.679 - Text: well keep an eye on that neiro also this\nTime: 1867.279 - Text: is a layer one so when you look at fdv\nTime: 1869.919 - Text: you have to keep in mind layer one fds\nTime: 1872.559 - Text: uh also New coin had the pump is now\nTime: 1876.32 - Text: having the dump it listed on the 13th um\nTime: 1880.399 - Text: and as it goes sideways and finds\nTime: 1882.399 - Text: equilibrium it's a good uh opportunity\nTime: 1884.799 - Text: because likely it is to go up afterwards\nTime: 1887.279 - Text: uh so those two are new what is more new\nTime: 1889.679 - Text: there was one more new I think that's it\nTime: 1891.72 - Text: but anyway these ones we're going to\nTime: 1893.72 - Text: follow um well depends on how they do\nTime: 1895.96 - Text: but if they really break to the upside\nTime: 1897.88 - Text: from this formation then we're going to\nTime: 1899.72 - Text: keep following them if they go and you\nTime: 1901.279 - Text: know they do more Kaka to the downside\nTime: 1903.44 - Text: then it's not going to be fun so we\nTime: 1905.799 - Text: follow I mean we follow things if they\nTime: 1908.0 - Text: perform basically if they perform we\nTime: 1909.72 - Text: follow that's\nTime: 1911.08 - Text: it uh game Swift We have the following\nTime: 1914.2 - Text: situation nice pump since the start\nTime: 1916.919 - Text: sideways Crea a new high here a few\nTime: 1919.72 - Text: weeks back two weeks back now a bit of a\nTime: 1922.12 - Text: discount uh as you know we're bullish on\nTime: 1924.12 - Text: game Swift and they have been performing\nTime: 1925.76 - Text: so nice AIT massive I mean this thing is\nTime: 1930.039 - Text: insane guys with AIT it's been insane\nTime: 1932.76 - Text: right like here from\nTime: 1935.0 - Text: 0.08 it now it is at a 10x uh but it was\nTime: 1938.88 - Text: even higher it went to 1.17 now it's a\nTime: 1941.279 - Text: massive discount actually and again it's\nTime: 1943.48 - Text: still accelerating down if you wait for\nTime: 1945.24 - Text: it to find a bit of a sideways uh it's a\nTime: 1947.919 - Text: is going to be a good opportunity\nTime: 1948.96 - Text: because then likely it is to do new it's\nTime: 1950.799 - Text: kind of like here you know\nTime: 1952.76 - Text: uh it's kind of like here it it created\nTime: 1955.279 - Text: a new high then it went down and then\nTime: 1958.36 - Text: Boop went up again uh next let's see\nTime: 1962.639 - Text: what man is doing Mana uh got rejected\nTime: 1965.559 - Text: here trying to create a new high uh so\nTime: 1968.48 - Text: yeah likely to go sideways and then try\nTime: 1970.2 - Text: again keep an eye there and pixels\nTime: 1972.279 - Text: pixels I love pixels guys I love pixels\nTime: 1975.84 - Text: this thing is also at a discount still\nTime: 1977.919 - Text: accelerating down basically I mean all\nTime: 1979.799 - Text: coins are the same analysis guys I don't\nTime: 1981.639 - Text: know what to tell the same analysis look\nTime: 1983.48 - Text: at the team look at what they're doing\nTime: 1985.559 - Text: like pixel is crazy metric but all in\nTime: 1987.88 - Text: all it's the same analysis everywhere if\nTime: 1989.96 - Text: you follow good coins they are likely\nTime: 1992.32 - Text: now uh just consolidating after a\nTime: 1995.32 - Text: massive pump so likely they have pumped\nTime: 1997.2 - Text: and they're down a bit and they're\nTime: 1998.799 - Text: consolidating so it's the same analysis\nTime: 2001.36 - Text: if they're accelerating down you can\nTime: 2003.519 - Text: chill out a bit if they have already\nTime: 2005.559 - Text: finished acceleration down and now going\nTime: 2007.36 - Text: sideways likely good likely good\nTime: 2010.279 - Text: opportunity um what's what else guys\nTime: 2012.24 - Text: there is a new coin coming and that's\nTime: 2014.559 - Text: Arc this one is likely to do well\nTime: 2017.6 - Text: because it is a Perpetual Dex okay kind\nTime: 2020.159 - Text: of like bit by by decentralized uh if\nTime: 2023.12 - Text: you go to Arc digital and you follow\nTime: 2026.0 - Text: here and you join the Moon Festival\nTime: 2028.559 - Text: basically you need to try the the\nTime: 2030.12 - Text: product you read up on their Moon\nTime: 2031.919 - Text: Festival you can mine their coin which\nTime: 2034.559 - Text: will be released probably within a few\nTime: 2036.6 - Text: weeks and um yeah basically this is the\nTime: 2039.76 - Text: centralized bit uh let's see how they do\nTime: 2041.96 - Text: but the from idea perspective it's quite\nTime: 2044.679 - Text: interesting at the end of the day you\nTime: 2046.559 - Text: know if you think five years ahead we're\nTime: 2048.079 - Text: all going to be trading on dexes\nTime: 2049.48 - Text: everything you do on buybit is going to\nTime: 2050.839 - Text: be decentralized everything you do on\nTime: 2052.159 - Text: binance is going to be decentralized so\nTime: 2053.919 - Text: it's just a question of when and how\nTime: 2055.44 - Text: good the tech is finally guys before we\nTime: 2057.839 - Text: go to Q&A let me speak a bit about this\nTime: 2061.079 - Text: topic of quantum people are sometimes\nTime: 2063.04 - Text: are asking this is a this is a recurring\nTime: 2065.8 - Text: question I get all the time for like six\nTime: 2067.44 - Text: years I'm here what about Quantum what\nTime: 2070.8 - Text: about Quantum is it a problem if quantum\nTime: 2075.76 - Text: computers come online and then they just\nTime: 2077.839 - Text: you know wreck all Bitcoin holders they\nTime: 2080.56 - Text: steal all your coins can you create a\nTime: 2083.399 - Text: quantum computer that just steals\nTime: 2086.48 - Text: everything it takes and runs away with\nTime: 2088.44 - Text: your coins is it possible well just as\nTime: 2091.679 - Text: to set the scene we do see companies\nTime: 2093.48 - Text: starting to prepare so in February we\nTime: 2095.72 - Text: did have announcement that apple is\nTime: 2098.44 - Text: future proving I iMessage with\nTime: 2100.68 - Text: postquantum cryptography we are seeing\nTime: 2103.68 - Text: governments like for example EU\nTime: 2105.68 - Text: government is right now using a con\nTime: 2108.48 - Text: platform in order to secure their Tech\nTime: 2110.96 - Text: stack their government Tech stack and\nTime: 2113.0 - Text: you're seeing all of these different\nTime: 2114.359 - Text: moves across the world with more and\nTime: 2116.8 - Text: more governments companies uh using\nTime: 2119.64 - Text: different Tech to protect themselves and\nTime: 2122.44 - Text: in\nTime: 2123.2 - Text: Bitcoin we haven't heard a lot we\nTime: 2125.839 - Text: haven't seen a lot we haven't heard a\nTime: 2127.24 - Text: lot so what's happening in Bitcoin are\nTime: 2129.56 - Text: we secure against Quantum or not so\nTime: 2132.44 - Text: here's the answer all in all when you\nTime: 2135.28 - Text: look at crypto it is not possible to do\nTime: 2138.839 - Text: anything against it with current uh\nTime: 2141.64 - Text: Quantum Computing like it's it's\nTime: 2143.119 - Text: impossible currently it's impossible you\nTime: 2144.92 - Text: need so much even of quantum computers\nTime: 2148.04 - Text: so many of them that it's not feasible\nTime: 2151.359 - Text: you need like millions of them uh now\nTime: 2154.16 - Text: what is important though is that look\nTime: 2156.88 - Text: here by the way so according to\nTime: 2158.52 - Text: researchers at University of sasx a\nTime: 2160.839 - Text: quantum computer with 1.9 billion Cubit\nTime: 2164.04 - Text: of processing power would be needed to\nTime: 2165.68 - Text: break into Bitcoin Network within um 10\nTime: 2167.88 - Text: minutes so if you have this this kind of\nTime: 2169.72 - Text: computer you can do it however no one\nTime: 2172.28 - Text: has this uh kind of computer because\nTime: 2174.56 - Text: this would require hackers to deploy\nTime: 2176.4 - Text: millions of quantum computers a scenario\nTime: 2178.8 - Text: that is highly unlikely so right now\nTime: 2181.44 - Text: it's unlikely it's not likely now at the\nTime: 2185.2 - Text: same time you all have seen the advances\nTime: 2187.24 - Text: in a AI where AI went from like zero in\nTime: 2191.24 - Text: the public eye at least to Chad GPT\nTime: 2194.119 - Text: we've had our the world has had is Chad\nTime: 2196.319 - Text: GPT moment and so that was preceded by\nTime: 2202.52 - Text: maybe 10 years of quite heavy AI\nTime: 2206.72 - Text: research which was public so for example\nTime: 2208.599 - Text: I can tell you I have a bit of a\nTime: 2209.76 - Text: personal uh story here because I was in\nTime: 2213.44 - Text: university in 2016 and also in 2017 and\nTime: 2218.079 - Text: um uh I was studying computer science so\nTime: 2221.079 - Text: I had some AI courses like machine\nTime: 2223.16 - Text: learning and that's I mean at that point\nTime: 2225.28 - Text: that's when a lot of these papers came\nTime: 2227.72 - Text: out with generative AI uh that you you\nTime: 2231.16 - Text: know man you can generate a\nTime: 2233.079 - Text: picture it doesn't copy a picture like\nTime: 2235.76 - Text: it just generates it out of nowhere it\nTime: 2238.119 - Text: has the neural network and gen generates\nTime: 2239.88 - Text: it out of nowhere and I remember\nTime: 2242.599 - Text: thinking man that's cool that's awesome\nTime: 2245.2 - Text: so you I mean already at that point I\nTime: 2247.359 - Text: knew knew like it is coming it was\nTime: 2249.8 - Text: impossible to say whether because that\nTime: 2251.319 - Text: was 2017 it was impossible to say\nTime: 2253.44 - Text: whether it was going to come in like\nTime: 2255.119 - Text: 2018 or 19 but it really became massive\nTime: 2258.52 - Text: in 2023 like all the St with AI it took\nTime: 2261.76 - Text: six years but so if you were like in you\nTime: 2265.079 - Text: didn't even have to be like a professor\nTime: 2266.92 - Text: because many people studied the computer\nTime: 2268.599 - Text: science so if you have studied the\nTime: 2269.68 - Text: computer science you took any AI course\nTime: 2271.8 - Text: in 2016 2017 I mean you kind of knew\nTime: 2275.119 - Text: that it is coming you kind of knew that\nTime: 2276.76 - Text: man is getting super close another thing\nTime: 2279.2 - Text: was the alpha go when Alpha go won over\nTime: 2282.359 - Text: that go Champion when was that was it\nTime: 2284.359 - Text: 2015 Alpha go\nTime: 2287.04 - Text: one um let's see this was another thing\nTime: 2290.839 - Text: which signaled that AI is like really uh\nTime: 2295.76 - Text: really developing at a pace which is not\nTime: 2299.4 - Text: common like in 2016 this happened and\nTime: 2302.56 - Text: when you look back at the you know in\nTime: 2304.16 - Text: 2010 you look back on the in 2005\nTime: 2307.96 - Text: like the development speed of AI at\nTime: 2310.48 - Text: those points is so much slower than we\nTime: 2314.16 - Text: saw in 2016 so in 2016 2017 like if you\nTime: 2317.839 - Text: were in like computer science you are a\nTime: 2319.839 - Text: student you don't even have to be like\nTime: 2321.359 - Text: super big brain you knew that you know\nTime: 2324.2 - Text: it is really transforming like this AI\nTime: 2326.28 - Text: stuff man it's it's really becoming fast\nTime: 2329.079 - Text: at that point it was still not like good\nTime: 2331.52 - Text: enough to to see that it will transform\nTime: 2333.8 - Text: the world this year or next year but you\nTime: 2336.44 - Text: could still feel it and it happened six\nTime: 2338.359 - Text: years later so with\nTime: 2340.92 - Text: Quantum I don't have the same impression\nTime: 2343.4 - Text: but also it's not that like widespread\nTime: 2346.52 - Text: that people Tinker with quantum computer\nTime: 2348.8 - Text: with AI you can be a student you can\nTime: 2350.64 - Text: pull up some you know model on your\nTime: 2352.76 - Text: computer you you mess around a bit with\nTime: 2354.92 - Text: python uh you can get stuff going so AI\nTime: 2358.319 - Text: is also more accessible uh so because of\nTime: 2361.4 - Text: that more people could see it including\nTime: 2363.52 - Text: myself like it was quite clear that that\nTime: 2365.48 - Text: it's that it's coming with quantum maybe\nTime: 2367.72 - Text: it's not like that may because you need\nTime: 2369.72 - Text: the this heartburn stuff and it's h you\nTime: 2371.64 - Text: need to like cool it or something I\nTime: 2373.119 - Text: don't know how how that will work for\nTime: 2374.64 - Text: the everyday person uh but all in all\nTime: 2378.0 - Text: this is what am I saying all of this for\nTime: 2381.079 - Text: we will see probably 10 years before\nTime: 2384.319 - Text: Quantum really becomes uh feasible to\nTime: 2387.2 - Text: use for for for example cracking uh\nTime: 2389.88 - Text: crypto we will see quite intense\nTime: 2392.72 - Text: research and quite intense leaps in\nTime: 2396.0 - Text: research with 10 years before real world\nTime: 2401.0 - Text: applications become valid and uh become\nTime: 2404.359 - Text: real just like with AI the public\nTime: 2406.76 - Text: learned about AI in\nTime: 2408.68 - Text: 2023 uh everyone who was like in\nTime: 2411.28 - Text: computers knew about it in 2017 2016\nTime: 2414.599 - Text: okay in Quantum I feel it's going to be\nTime: 2417.319 - Text: the same that uh uh it's going to be\nTime: 2420.24 - Text: maybe 10 years before this we really see\nTime: 2421.96 - Text: man another paper published another\nTime: 2423.88 - Text: research man now they can do this now\nTime: 2425.92 - Text: they can do that obviously ly we will we\nTime: 2428.24 - Text: don't have to wait for that to start\nTime: 2430.0 - Text: preparing so Bitcoin should already now\nTime: 2432.119 - Text: in my view start switching to Quantum\nTime: 2435.319 - Text: proof algorithms so this is how we solve\nTime: 2437.88 - Text: it while Quantum Computing One Challenge\nTime: 2440.24 - Text: cryptocurrencies in their present form\nTime: 2441.839 - Text: it will require a concerted effort to\nTime: 2444.48 - Text: introduce a raft of changes that will\nTime: 2446.319 - Text: preserve the centralized governance\nTime: 2448.24 - Text: against quantum computers and so we can\nTime: 2450.44 - Text: start changing staff already and start\nTime: 2452.64 - Text: implementing Quantum resistance\nTime: 2454.48 - Text: algorithm algorithms because there are\nTime: 2457.92 - Text: such algorithms there are S I mean we\nTime: 2459.92 - Text: can start we can start onboarding them\nTime: 2462.92 - Text: into Bitcoin just like apple is doing\nTime: 2464.64 - Text: with imessage we can start onboarding\nTime: 2466.8 - Text: them into Bitcoin now apple is a bit\nTime: 2470.96 - Text: more\nTime: 2472.16 - Text: stressed why because if you have a\nTime: 2475.079 - Text: quantum computer that can break\nTime: 2478.839 - Text: encryption of current state-ofthe-art\nTime: 2482.48 - Text: uh uh encryption\nTime: 2485.2 - Text: algorithms then it means that everything\nTime: 2488.319 - Text: you said online today that you thought\nTime: 2490.4 - Text: is encrypted is going to be decrypted in\nTime: 2492.72 - Text: the future this is quite\nTime: 2494.88 - Text: interesting everything we do online\nTime: 2497.28 - Text: everything you write even if it's\nTime: 2500.079 - Text: encrypted if someone has collected your\nTime: 2503.319 - Text: encrypted messages they will be\nTime: 2505.88 - Text: decrypted in the future that's quite\nTime: 2507.72 - Text: scary that's why apple is introducing\nTime: 2509.72 - Text: this Quantum proof already because they\nTime: 2512.48 - Text: know that if\nTime: 2514.079 - Text: you chat using apple and let's say say\nTime: 2517.44 - Text: your internet provider your ISP is\nTime: 2520.4 - Text: saving all of the encrypted packets\nTime: 2523.119 - Text: currently they cannot read them because\nTime: 2524.92 - Text: it's endtoend\nTime: 2526.079 - Text: encrypted but in 10 years there is\nTime: 2531.64 - Text: quantum they can decrypt all the old\nTime: 2534.079 - Text: messages that's scary and I can tell you\nTime: 2536.52 - Text: there are companies that are working\nTime: 2539.68 - Text: currently with collecting encrypted\nTime: 2541.88 - Text: packets because they know at some point\nTime: 2544.24 - Text: it will be possible to decrypt and they\nTime: 2545.92 - Text: have a massive business crypting all of\nTime: 2547.8 - Text: that it's happening right now that's why\nTime: 2551.04 - Text: it's important for messaging apps to be\nTime: 2553.24 - Text: Quantum proof ASAP ASAP and the\nTime: 2556.76 - Text: population doesn't think about the\nTime: 2558.4 - Text: consequences of what will happen in case\nTime: 2561.4 - Text: all of your existing encrypted messages\nTime: 2563.16 - Text: are decrypted in the future but you got\nTime: 2565.0 - Text: to think about it you you got to think\nTime: 2566.559 - Text: about it because they will be decrypted\nTime: 2568.28 - Text: and if someone has collected your\nTime: 2569.92 - Text: messages in in their encrypted form is\nTime: 2572.64 - Text: just a question of time before it's\nTime: 2574.24 - Text: decrypted so anyway that's a bit about\nTime: 2577.359 - Text: the quantum so to summarize listen\nTime: 2579.52 - Text: Quantum likely is far\nTime: 2583.359 - Text: away at the level at an extent where it\nTime: 2586.559 - Text: can break Bitcoin it will probably\nTime: 2589.319 - Text: probably be preceded by 10 or so years\nTime: 2592.96 - Text: maybe a bit less maybe like six years\nTime: 2594.839 - Text: like it was with AI of super research\nTime: 2597.68 - Text: like you see research after research\nTime: 2599.04 - Text: paper they're advancing super\nTime: 2601.16 - Text: quick um so once we see that then it's\nTime: 2604.0 - Text: really time to hurry uh but we shouldn't\nTime: 2606.48 - Text: wait for that we you should already now\nTime: 2607.96 - Text: start switching to to Quantum resistant\nTime: 2611.64 - Text: in in Bitcoin but anyway that's it guys\nTime: 2613.48 - Text: that's it guys let's go to Q&A questions\nTime: 2615.64 - Text: answers debates discussions and maybe we\nTime: 2617.64 - Text: have some Quantum physicists in the chat\nTime: 2619.839 - Text: who can tell us\nTime: 2621.04 - Text: more um what do you think if you if you\nTime: 2623.839 - Text: are a certified Quantum physicist\nTime: 2627.0 - Text: Quantum Computing physicist let us know\nTime: 2629.599 - Text: in the chat what do you\nTime: 2635.68 - Text: think game over Bitcoin\nTime: 2639.359 - Text: dumping we are at\nTime: 2644.72 - Text: 67.3 are you holding you know\nTime: 2650.0 - Text: what or are you not holding let me know\nTime: 2652.44 - Text: in the comment\nTime: 2656.68 - Text: section while apple and the FBI exist\nTime: 2659.8 - Text: your data is not private on\nTime: 2662.76 - Text: Apple uh\nTime: 2665.64 - Text: well I don't know how Apple has changed\nTime: 2668.2 - Text: in recent years but historically they\nTime: 2670.04 - Text: have been quite good at preserving uh\nTime: 2672.68 - Text: privacy even when FBI was forcing them\nTime: 2676.0 - Text: there was this famous case where FBI\nTime: 2678.68 - Text: wanted Apple to unlock a phone but they\nTime: 2681.88 - Text: refused uh there was this famous famous\nTime: 2685.0 - Text: case you guys can find it online I don't\nTime: 2687.2 - Text: know if that has changed because\nTime: 2688.68 - Text: obviously companies changed uh change\nTime: 2691.079 - Text: companies get infiltrated by new\nTime: 2693.8 - Text: Executives and new interest so maybe\nTime: 2695.72 - Text: it's different now\nTime: 2697.96 - Text: but I can tell you that a big portion of\nTime: 2700.8 - Text: Apple's business model is due to their\nTime: 2703.119 - Text: privacy it's a massive portion because\nTime: 2706.0 - Text: on Android it's a big problem man you\nTime: 2708.8 - Text: don't know what the hell is running you\nTime: 2710.68 - Text: you don't it's a massive problem so\nTime: 2712.839 - Text: let's say you work in business you are\nTime: 2714.96 - Text: an executive you I mean you have some\nTime: 2717.24 - Text: secret stuff on your on your\nTime: 2719.76 - Text: phone on Android man you download APK\nTime: 2724.52 - Text: you click something viral installed like\nTime: 2727.96 - Text: it's way more likely just from a\nTime: 2729.88 - Text: security standpoint but also from this\nTime: 2731.48 - Text: you know privacy standpoint because\nTime: 2733.8 - Text: Android is also Google and who the hell\nTime: 2736.079 - Text: knows what the hell they're collecting\nTime: 2737.96 - Text: man with\nTime: 2739.72 - Text: Google it's it's uh I don't know the\nTime: 2743.24 - Text: reality but I I can tell you from a from\nTime: 2745.96 - Text: my impression like gut feeling level if\nTime: 2748.72 - Text: I'm to use the gut feeling gut feeling\nTime: 2750.319 - Text: you cannot use in the market but when it\nTime: 2751.8 - Text: comes to these things on the gut feeling\nTime: 2754.119 - Text: level it feels like Google they just\nTime: 2755.72 - Text: suck like they they they're whole\nTime: 2757.319 - Text: business model like Google doesn't have\nTime: 2758.88 - Text: any business model guys outside of ads\nTime: 2761.96 - Text: so why would they not just vacuum they\nTime: 2764.2 - Text: take a fat vacuum they vacuum your whole\nTime: 2767.119 - Text: phone okay now obviously they have to do\nTime: 2769.52 - Text: it in a compliant way so they vacuum in\nTime: 2772.839 - Text: a way so that they cannot be sued but\nTime: 2775.48 - Text: man if they can vacuum they're gonna\nTime: 2778.2 - Text: they're gonna suck it up okay they're\nTime: 2779.839 - Text: gonna they because what look at them\nTime: 2782.559 - Text: follow the money follow the money does\nTime: 2785.16 - Text: Google make money from the freaking\nTime: 2786.64 - Text: andro Android not really man not really\nTime: 2788.839 - Text: do they make money from the phone no\nTime: 2790.72 - Text: Samsung makes money from phone or LG or\nTime: 2794.0 - Text: what the hell you buy to have a phone\nTime: 2795.8 - Text: with with Google uh with Android so why\nTime: 2799.839 - Text: the hell do they have this Android One\nTime: 2802.559 - Text: Reason vacuum it's vacuuming vacuuming\nTime: 2805.68 - Text: all the datas okay and\nTime: 2809.319 - Text: also uh because it is more open which is\nTime: 2812.8 - Text: great it's open platform but also\nTime: 2815.48 - Text: accidentally installing some\nTime: 2817.44 - Text: spyware and uh not get vacuumed by\nTime: 2820.119 - Text: Google but get vacuumed by uh by uh you\nTime: 2823.44 - Text: know some criminal\nTime: 2825.359 - Text: entity uh is just easier because Boop\nTime: 2828.16 - Text: you click something wrecked so that's\nTime: 2830.079 - Text: why like a massive\nTime: 2832.079 - Text: portion a massive portion of Apple's\nTime: 2834.48 - Text: business model is this privacy and\nTime: 2836.76 - Text: safety because you work in business like\nTime: 2839.119 - Text: you look at the uh you look at which\nTime: 2841.72 - Text: phones are used uh by Executives I mean\nTime: 2845.2 - Text: most mostly Apple mostly Apple\nTime: 2847.44 - Text: just because like you know as a company\nTime: 2849.8 - Text: if you are to give your employees phones\nTime: 2852.079 - Text: you just know man if we give them iPhone\nTime: 2854.96 - Text: is going to be a bit safer a bit less\nTime: 2857.599 - Text: risk and so on and so forth so if Apple\nTime: 2860.88 - Text: start messing with that they start like\nTime: 2863.0 - Text: too much uh meddling with the Privacy\nTime: 2865.88 - Text: they're going to lose a lot man they're\nTime: 2867.16 - Text: going to lose a lot they so I I I I\nTime: 2869.8 - Text: wouldn't think that they are that they\nTime: 2871.559 - Text: have changed because that would be so\nTime: 2874.359 - Text: unsmart uh so I hope they haven't\nTime: 2876.44 - Text: changed\nTime: 2884.8 - Text: Sam you didn't like my certified Quantum\nTime: 2888.16 - Text: phys I didn't I didn't see it\nTime: 2890.839 - Text: man people don't understand the\nTime: 2892.64 - Text: difference between security and private\nTime: 2893.96 - Text: security is easy not to mention you can\nTime: 2895.76 - Text: track anyone with air tag not sure what\nTime: 2899.16 - Text: you mean that but yeah air tag you got\nTime: 2901.079 - Text: to be careful but you're see if you have\nTime: 2904.76 - Text: iPhone it will tell you if someone is\nTime: 2906.92 - Text: tracking you with an air\nTime: 2909.119 - Text: tag uh I think they have that feature uh\nTime: 2911.64 - Text: built in that if you have an iPhone and\nTime: 2913.839 - Text: it feels that there is some air tag\nTime: 2916.24 - Text: constantly uh close to you that you\nTime: 2919.88 - Text: don't own it will tell\nTime: 2928.079 - Text: you the agency called it Cooperative\nTime: 2930.559 - Text: compliance on behalf of banks okay okay\nTime: 2933.16 - Text: some something about\nTime: 2935.72 - Text: Banks\nTime: 2939.079 - Text: why you talk about Google when crypto\nTime: 2941.24 - Text: Market is blood\nTime: 2942.839 - Text: bathing rewatch from the start rewatch\nTime: 2946.16 - Text: from the\nTime: 2948.76 - Text: start you have some rewatching to\nTime: 2956.76 - Text: do greeting from Canada okay guys that's\nTime: 2959.599 - Text: it uh rewatch from the start if you\nTime: 2962.28 - Text: recently joined we just analyze the H\nTime: 2964.4 - Text: Market analyze the co the alts analyzed\nTime: 2968.24 - Text: everything check out the bit link below\nTime: 2970.48 - Text: for shorting for longing and uh see you\nTime: 2973.4 - Text: all by by the way I I love the saying\nTime: 2975.48 - Text: you know Market is blood\nTime: 2979.2 - Text: bathing the market is blood\nTime: 2982.16 - Text: bathing man look at the blood\nTime: 2986.52 - Text: bath one\nTime: 2988.28 - Text: second I I love this thinging the guy\nTime: 2991.0 - Text: was just like why are you speaking about\nTime: 2992.319 - Text: Google\nTime: 2993.16 - Text: marketing look at this blood bath C\nTime: 2996.76 - Text: crazy\nTime: 2999.68 - Text: man as long as you are on weekly or\nTime: 3004.0 - Text: monthly there's no blood\nTime: 3006.2 - Text: bath look at the blood bath guys crazy\nTime: 3009.559 - Text: blood bath insane blood bath anyway I I\nTime: 3012.52 - Text: I just love that expression because it's\nTime: 3014.96 - Text: it's also a sign of the gut feeling see\nTime: 3018.64 - Text: this is why you don't have to follow gut\nTime: 3020.119 - Text: feeling your G feeling is like oh it's\nTime: 3021.52 - Text: blood bath it is blood bath it's bathing\nTime: 3024.68 - Text: in blood you take a baby bathing you\nTime: 3027.319 - Text: need a bathing suit man so you can you\nTime: 3029.839 - Text: can be part of the bath if you have the\nTime: 3032.319 - Text: money line you don't need to be part of\nTime: 3034.119 - Text: the bath you are zooming out you're\nTime: 3037.2 -
